The website does not create any tables so you must first delete all tables that might exist
from past attempts using "DROP TABLE tablename;" and create these tables one by one using
the commands provided. This is all done in phpmyadmin

// User table
CREATE TABLE User(
  userID      int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
  username    varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  password    varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  firstName   varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  lastName    varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  phoneNumber varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  email       varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  biography   text,
  PRIMARY KEY (userID)
);

// Subject table
CREATE TABLE Subject(
  subjectID   int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
  subject     varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  adminUserID int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (subjectID),
  FOREIGN KEY (adminUserID) REFERENCES User(userID)
);

// Tutoring Proposal table
CREATE TABLE TutoringProposal(
  tutoringProposalID  int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
  tutorUserID         int(11) NOT NULL,
  subjectID           int(11) NOT NULL,
  description         text,
  active              tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY         (tutoringProposalID),
  FOREIGN KEY         (tutorUserID) REFERENCES User(userID),
  FOREIGN KEY         (subjectID)   REFERENCES Subject(subjectID)
);

// Session table
CREATE TABLE Session(
  sessionID       int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
  studentUserID   int(11) NOT NULL,
  tutorProposalID int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY     (sessionID),
  FOREIGN KEY     (studentUserID)   REFERENCES User(userID),
  FOREIGN KEY     (tutorProposalID) REFERENCES TutoringProposal(tutoringProposalID)
);

Once all of the tables are created and you can see them in your "localhost:8080/Tutoropolis/phpmyadmin"
browser (where you will execute the commands) you can sign up and create a user. This is done by
going to the welcome.php page and filling out the info in the sign up area. When submitted you can
actually check the User table in phpmyadmin and see if it worked correctly. If it did then it's userID
should be 1. You are going to go into the phpmyadmin and execute this command which inserts the different
subjects into the subject table with the adminID set to your user id for the user just created.

INSERT INTO
	Subject(subject, adminUserID)
VALUES
	("Computer Science", 1),
	("Math", 1),
        ("Engineering", 1),
        ("Physics", 1),
        ("Biology", 1),
        ("Chemistry", 1),
        ("Business", 1),
        ("Writing", 1),
        ("Languages", 1),
        ("History", 1),
        ("Art", 1);

After that command is executed you will be able to use everything in the website. I suggest making
a second user and submitting some tutoring proposals for different subjects. Then creating a third
user and going in and creating a session for some of those tutoring proposals and them going to
the home page and seeing that all of those proposals should be there. You should see three different
usernames if you did it this way. One for the current user you are, then info for that second user
you created the tutoring proposals for, then third for the admin that was the first user you created

Site should not be fully functioning and you can test it more to see if you can find any bugs.
